## Features

*   **Add Alerts:** Easily add new cryptocurrency price alerts with customizable conditions (above or below a threshold) and target prices in USD.
*   **Remove Alerts:** Delete existing alerts when they are no longer needed.
*   **List Alerts:** View all currently active alerts with their details.
*   **Start Monitoring:** Initiate price monitoring in the background to continuously check for alert conditions.
*   **Stop Monitoring:** Halt the background monitoring process.

## Requirements

1.  **Termux:** Android terminal emulator application.
    *   [Install Termux from F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/) or [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux)

2.  **Termux-API App:**  **Crucially, you need to install the Termux-API *app* (APK) in addition to the Termux-API package within Termux.**
    *   Download the Termux-API app APK from:
        *   [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux.api/) (Recommended)
        *   [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/termux/termux-api/releases)
    *   Install the downloaded APK on your Android device.
    *   After installation, grant necessary permissions to Termux-API app when prompted by Android (especially for notifications and storage if you plan to use custom sounds from shared storage).

3.  **Termux Packages:** Install the following packages within Termux:
    *   **Python:**
        ```bash
        pkg install python
        ```
    *   **Termux-API package:**
        ```bash
        pkg install termux-api
        ```
    *   **MPV (Recommended):** For playing alert sounds.
        ```bash
        pkg install mpv
        ```

4.  **Python Libraries:** Install required Python libraries using `pip`
    *   Ensure you have `pip` installed for Python in Termux

    **Install Python `requests` Library:
    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```

### NOTE:
 **Sound Files : If you want to use custom alert sounds, place `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.flac`, or `.ogg` sound files             in the same directory as the script. Otherwise, you can enter the full path to a sound file located anywhere             on your device when prompted to select a sound.**

## Background Monitoring Notes

*   When "üöÄ Start Monitoring" is selected, the script initiates a background process to monitor prices.
*   Always use "‚èπÔ∏è Stop Monitoring" from the menu to properly halt the background process. Closing the Termux session might not immediately stop it.
*   Be aware of Android and Termux background execution limitations, which might affect long-term reliability of background monitoring, especially on devices with aggressive battery optimization.

## Customization

*   **Alert Sounds:** Place custom sound files (`.mp3`, `.wav`, `.flac`, `.ogg`) in the same directory as `TermuxCryptoAlert.py`. The script will detect these and allow you to choose them when adding alerts.
